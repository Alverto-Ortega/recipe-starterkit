### Documentation

#### Overview

This project is a recipe management application that allows users to add and view recipes. It uses a modern web stack including Vite, React, CSS Modules, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL.

#### Key Components

1. **Frontend**:
   - **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
   - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - **CSS Modules**: A CSS file in which all class and animation names are scoped locally by default.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
   - **Apollo Server**: A community-driven, open-source GraphQL server.
   - **GraphQL**: A query language for your API.
   - **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

3. **Real-time**:
   - **GraphQL Subscriptions**: Enables real-time updates.
   - **WebSocket**: A protocol for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

#### Code Explanation

1. **Server Configuration (`server.js`)**:
   - Sets up the Express server.
   - Configures the PostgreSQL connection pool.
   - Initializes Apollo Server with GraphQL schema and resolvers.
   - Sets up WebSocket for GraphQL subscriptions.

2. **GraphQL Schema (`schema.js`)**:
   - Defines the GraphQL types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

3. **GraphQL Resolvers (`resolvers.js`)**:
   - Implements the logic for fetching and manipulating data in response to GraphQL queries and mutations.
   - Uses PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval.

4. **Database Utility (`databaseUtils.js`)**:
   - Provides a utility function to manage PostgreSQL database connections.

5. **Frontend Components**:
   - **App.jsx**: Sets up the React Router and defines the main routes.
   - **Home.jsx, Recipes.jsx, About.jsx**: Define the different pages of the application.
   - **addRecipe.jsx, recipeList.jsx**: Handle adding new recipes and displaying the list of recipes.

6. **Apollo Client Setup (`main.jsx`)**:
   - Configures Apollo Client for GraphQL queries and subscriptions.
   - Sets up HTTP and WebSocket links for Apollo Client.

7. **Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)**:
   - Configures Vite for the project, including React plugin and CSS Modules.
